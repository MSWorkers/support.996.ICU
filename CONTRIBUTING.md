## Translation

Microsoft and GitHub are global companies with workers all around the world. While English and Chinese are the primary languages we support, we welcome translations of the letter into other languages. To do so, make a pull request with your translated version of the letter under `README_<language_code>.md`. For example, the Spanish translated version may look like `README_ES.md`. 

When creating the pull request for a language translation, please add a native speaker of the language you are translating to to review the contents of the pull request.

If you plan on translating the `README.md`, we ask that you consider yourself a native speaker and writer of the language you are translating to. Please only translate _from_ the English or Chinese version of the letter as we want to make sure that translations are as accurate as possible. 

## Other edits

We welcome other edits. Feel free to update the contents of the letter or even add new ideas to it. Pull requests to the contents of the letter will be heavily scrutinized during the review process and we cannot guarantee that most changes will be accepted. However, we are always happy to have those discussions.
